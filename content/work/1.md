###### [Kapow! Comics](http://kapow.us/)
My pet project for comic tracking and new release indexing. Large amount of constantly growing data (40 million+ rows in MySQL) being pulled from many different sources.

###### [Coupon Cactus](http://www.couponcactus.com/)
I do most of the middleware / API / database work on this site as an ongoing maintenance and development agreement. A new responsive site coming as soon as we get approval on a design.
Lots of mashed up technologies here, mostly Zend PHP framework, jQuery, custom CDN using memcached, sphinx search indexing, and more.

###### [Nicos Chimi](http://nicoschimi.com/)

###### [CancerLateFX](http://www.cancerlateeffects.org/)
A childhood cancer survivor support tool that tracks after effects and symptoms caused by treatment and how to handle them and discuss them with kids. 
Website uses CakePHP as the framework, Bootstrap and jQuery. The [mobile application](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/cancerlatefx/id725634267?mt=8) uses PhoneGap, jQuery Mobile and a custom node.js hook to load data.

###### [Reddaway Careers Portal / USF Careers Portals](http://careers.reddawayregional.com/)
A responsive portal that is created by a custom CakePHP output generator I created to create SEO-friendly flat HTML files that can be shared and indexed how the client requested. As new content is added or old content is changed, the portals are regenerated based on event triggers within a node.js monitor. Built using CakePHP, handlebars, LESS, Bootstrap and jQuery. 
The other brand portals are [New Penn](http://careers.newpenn.com/) and [Holland](http://careers.hollandregional.com/)

###### [CorgiCoin](http://corgicoin.com/)
A crypto-currency that I launched with a few friends. Much like BitCoin or LiteCoin, CorgiCoin can be 'mined' using computer hardware. I created the [client software](https://bitbucket.org/corgicoin/corgicoin-qt) (in C++ and QT) as well as the website and server daemon. The [website](https://bitbucket.org/corgicoin/corgicoin.com) utilizes an extremely simple responsive design in CakePHP with Bootstrap and jQuery.

<div class="dot"></div>

###### [CorgiCoin Foundation](http://corgicoin.org/)
Our 'foundation' where people can donate CorgiCoin to causes they want to support. I built a daemon server in Python that interacts with the coin daemon on the server which converts CorgiCoin into BitCoin via a broker API and sells to USD once goals are completed. The website is again extremely simple and responsive, again using CakePHP, Bootstrap and jQuery.

###### [University of Akron SuccessfulU](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/successful-u/id598954030?ls=1&mt=8)
Cross-platform application I built while with EYEMG for the University of Akron. Utilizes PhoneGap, jQuery Mobile, SQLite, extensive jQuery and some simple node.js/backbone.js interactivity to bulk load data as needed. In addition, some custom plugins were developed for iOS and Android using native code to hook into functionality requested by the client.
