#### <a name="about" id="about" class="anchor">About Me</a>

I'm a self-taught software engineer who originally wanted to be a graphic designer. I've worked as a developer, designer, project manager and development director. I've created software in everything from Microsoft .NET to Perl to COBOL. I love to create things people love to use.

I'm passionate about open-source development projects, a fanatic for PHP and an advocate for mobile-focused development.

I'm a dad of five terrific kids, a corgi and hedgehog owner, an avid gamer and a voracious comic book collector.

I'd love to see how I could help you or your business.
